Insights derived from Uber's publicly released dataset in the city of New York.

####Inspiration
Basically adding this project to my portfolio and learning a few methods.

####Challenges
Managing dates was a headache, spent 3 days after I hit a roadblock before I came back to finish the project. After countless searches, try and errors, I found out it was because I did not set up an appropriate timezone. An invaluable lesson and I feel projects give you that; practical experience you might not learn in courses.

####Technology used
The technology used for this project was R.
